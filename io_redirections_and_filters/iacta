"Alea iacta est" is a Latin phrase that means "the die is cast (thrown)". Suetonius credits Julius Caesar as having said it on January 10, 49 B.C when he led his army acro
ss the Rubicon river in Northern Italy. It means things have happened that can't be changed.The phrase is used in many languages to indicate that events have passed a
point of no return. The same event inspired another idiom with the same meaning "crossing the Rubicon". Ceaser was said to have borroed the phrase from Menander, the
famous Greek writer of comedy.In Latin alea refers to a game with dice and, more generally, a game of hazard of chance. Dice were common in Roman times and were usually
cast three at a time. There were two kinds. The six-sided dice were known in Latin as tesserae and the four-sided ones (rounded at each end) were known as tali.The phrase
has been adopted in Italian (Il dado è tratto), Romanian (Zarurile au fost aruncate), Spanish (La suerte está echada), French (Les dés sont jetés), Portuguese (A sorte
está lançada), Dutch (De teerling is geworpen), German (Der Würfel ist gefallen), Hungarian (A kocka el van vetve) and many other languages to indicate that events have pa
ssed a point ofno return.
